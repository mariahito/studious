Question1:
We I comment out the prototype getMaxMyObj() the compiler throws an error this is due to the fact that getMaxMyObj is not defined in the header therefore this function will not have any meaning on the cpp file

Question 2:
What does the numbers beside each name mean?
what is the role of the destructor in the program?

If I comment out the #iclude<iostream> from the svtest.cpp the program will continue to run without any porblems

Comment out the using namespace std; gives me a lot of error in the functions this is because without the using namespace std I would have to use colons to define the functions.

when do yo use #include<string> and #include<vector>  ?
